A half-baked theme for your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

The Half-Baked theme is a bold red, two-column theme that splits the index pages of your WordPress blog right down the middle. It has a fluid layout that's accented with rounded corners thanks to Alessandro Fulciniti's Nifty Corners Cube script and P.J. Onori's Sanscons icons.

Half-Baked is widget-aware, and you can highlight some of your sidebar content inside of Bruce Williams' Scriptaculous Accordion. There's also a Scriptaculous toggle for your post meta-data, Gravatar support and a pair of rollover icons that link to your Contact and About pages.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you're using WordPress version 2.7 or higher.
2. Place the half-baked theme folder in your WordPress themes directory.
3. Activate the Half-Baked theme on your WordPress themes administration panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme work with earlier versions of WordPress? =

No. The Half-Baked theme is compatible with WordPress version 2.7 or higher. It does not work with earlier versions of WordPress.

= What plugins does this theme support? =

The default sidebar is configured to work with the Fold Page List and Fold Category List plugins, the WordPress Related Posts plugin, and the FlickrRSS, Netflix and Scrobbler plugins.

Half-Baked is also "widget-aware," with several custom widgets and support for the Flexi Pages widget and the Feeds widget.

= How do I configure the Scriptaculous Accordion? =

The default sidebar will automatically place the FlickrRSS, Netflix and Scrobbler plugins inside the accordion if they're activated.

If you're using widgets, there's a built-in accordion widget that displays any widgets you choose. Go to the widgets administration panel and add the Half-Baked Accordion widget to "Sidebar 1." Sidebar 1 contains the widgets that will appear in your main sidebar. Next, add the widgets that you want to display inside the accordion to the "Accordion" sidebar.

Every widget that you place in the Accordion sidebar must have a title. If a widget doesn't have a title, it won't have a heading when it's displayed, and your users won't be able to open and close it by clicking on its heading.

= How do the rollover icons at the top and bottom of each page work? =

The rollover icons at the top and bottom of each page will automatically link to pages with "contact" and "about" slugs. If there are no pages with those slugs, the top icon will link to the blog's obfuscated administration e-mail address and the bottom icon will link to the WordPress home page.
